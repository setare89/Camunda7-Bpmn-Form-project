# Camunda7-Bpmn-Form-project
In chapter1, I have designed a very simple process using Camunda Modeler. These chapters will continue and gradually become more complex.
***********************************************************
In Chapter 2, along with the BPMN file, a very simple form has been added. Whenever a user is assigned and starts the process, this form will open for them in the Form section.

In Chapter 3, a connection to the database was established using a script and Groovy code.
Now, by entering a first name and last name, we can view the data in our target database.
